In the last few months, the Sars-CoV-2 or "coronavirus" has become a global pandemic causing stay-at-home orders and 
the shutting down of the majority of businesses in most countries.
The seriousness of this virus stems from its novelty, the rapid way in which it is able to spread, 
and the severity of symptoms in many of its victims.
In an effort to elucidate how the virus spreads, one can analyze the sequencing data taken from various countries around 
the world and align them.
Using an open-access site such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, 
data analyses can easily be performed and shared
in an attempt to further the development of a vaccine or to see how the virus is able to change as it travels.

For our project, we created a pipeline of scripts to download sequences from the NCBI database,
parse Accession numbers to pare down the data into a manageable form,
find key areas of interest in those sequences, such as the Open Reading Frame (ORF), 
align the sequences using ClustalOmega, and finally to create
a phylogenetic tree to show ancestry and to see how closely related the virus stems from Homo sapiens (humans), 
Rhinolophus sindicus (horseshoe bat), Manis javanica (pangolin), and Bungarus multicinctus (Many-banded krait snake).
