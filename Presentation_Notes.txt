Introduction:

We are all currently being affected by coronavirus and that is why we are all meeting through Zoom today
Sars CoV 2 has affected everyone globally and has created a pandemic due to lack of vaccine and because of its novelty

Being able to gain access to the virus' sequence from different regions of the world and compare those sequences
can give valuable insight into how it is mutating and how those mutations may affect people differently;
specifically with severity of symptoms, etc. 

For the first part of our project, we needed to be able to access the genetic sequences from NCBI's database, 
download them, and parse information for later use.

We then needed scripts to find ORFs and generally be able to find out basic information about each sequence. 

Using NCBI's BLAST (Basic Alignment Tool) the selected sequences could then be aligned against one another to show 
conservation and homology.

Lastly, using NCBI's Phylogenetic Tree software, we can then create relationship between these sequences in an 
effort to show origin, and how closely related they appear to be. This can give insight into how the virus 
is able to move.
