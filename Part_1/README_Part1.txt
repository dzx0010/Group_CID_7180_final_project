Welcome to our pipeline for analysis of COVID-19 sequences.

We are starting with the file COVID_Seqs.csv as a reference for accession numbers.

The first step will be to sort the accessions by country for comparison.
SortCut_filter.sh will copy the location and accession data to a separate file,
then copy out accessions from different countries.
